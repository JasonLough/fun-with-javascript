random experiments in javascript

All of these here are complete standalone web pages. Just copy / paste into your editor and experiment away.

sigmoid.htm : 
Creates an array, uses the values in it to draw the sigmoid function. Uses D3JS.

test_object.js : 
Creates an object, pulling a random element from an array to use as a key, a random number of times. Its just a way to quickly experiment with objects and arrays. Output is like: 
    {apples:2, oranges:6, plums:1}, or 
    {oranges:1, bananas:3, pears:3, plums2}
