### If youre into javascript, you just found a treasure room

This is a collection of things I found interesting with JavaScript. I wrote each of these to be (hopefully) easy to understand while showing a specific aspect (often a weird one) of JavaScript.

### My setup

I use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), with a terminal open, running node automatically on save. This allows me to quickly write -> evaluate -> repeat.

### My biggest piece of advice

Keep a developer log for yourself. A google sheet works nicely. Make it similar to this: 

| Date           | Topic                        | Notes                                                               |
| -------------- |:----------------------------:| -------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| 11/7/2019      | curry functions              | weird technique that abuses closures to make customizable functions |
| 11/8/2019      | recursion with currying      |   still wrapping my head around how this can be useful              |
