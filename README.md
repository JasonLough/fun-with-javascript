### If youre into javascript, you just found a treasure room

This is a collection of things I found interesting with JavaScript. I wrote each of these to be (hopefully) easy to understand while showing a specific aspect (often a weird one) of JavaScript. More added as I find time!

### My setup

I use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), with a terminal open, using nodemon to automatically run on save.

```npx nodemon myscript.js```

This allows me to quickly write -> evaluate -> repeat.

### My biggest piece of advice

Keep a developer log for yourself. A google sheet works nicely. Make it similar to this: 

| Date           | Topic                        | Notes                                                               |
| -------------- |:----------------------------:| -------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| 11/7/2019      | curry functions              | weird technique that abuses closures to make customizable functions |
| 11/8/2019      | recursion with currying      |   still wrapping my head around how this can be useful              |

### Glossary of /scripts 

note: (OLD) = stuff I wrote > 3 yrs ago

* curry.js - if a()()() scares you, go here

* dynamic-templates-in-pure-javascript.htm - (OLD) using script type="text/template" you can write functions to make your own template. No libraries required.

* ES6-underscore-D3JS - (OLD) makes a bar graph of random numbers, sorts them, charts them, assigns color based on above or below average

* getters-setters.js - fun with getters and setters

* memoization.js - (OLD) caching function results in a lookup table

* noitatoN-hsiloP-esreveR.php - (OLD) Reverse Polish Notation, aka "How a calculator could work". Did this one for an interview test a long time ago, I should remake it in JS.

* rock-paper-ES6.js - (OLD) stupid simple rock paper scissor simulator with custom test function

* sigmoid.htm - (OLD) visualize a sigmoid function with D3.js

* simple-pub-sub-event-handler.js - collect events in an array, trigger them on event

* test-object.js - (OLD) makes an array with a random number of fruit elements in it
